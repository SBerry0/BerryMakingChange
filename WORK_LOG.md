My plan is to finish that and then try some speedups to the algorithm and see where it goes from there |

The first is that I'm recounting the same combination multiple times, I had a plan for this but it doesn't work because of the second issue, which is that with this current code, I can't figure out how to uninclude a branch that doesn't lead to a sum adding up to the target. |
| 2/2/25  | 9:00-10:00pm | After some thinking about how else I would go about solving this, I decided to try changing the coins as well as the sum as we learned from the hint. I also was trying to calculate the largest coin first, then calculate how many of the smaller coins could go into the larger coin and that was I wouldn't have to recalculate the smaller ones for each one the larger was already calculated. Unfortunately, it's not working too well. |

I have to figure out how I'm going to standardize the indices of the 2d array. |
