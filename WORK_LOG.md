| 1/27/25 |  9:00-9:50am  |                                                                                                                                                                                              After some thinking, I decided to try a recursive approach so that I could try every possibility of coins together and just count that up. My plan is to finish that and then try some speedups to the algorithm and see where it goes from there |
| 2/2/25  |  7:50-8:30pm  |                                                                               I got a running version of my plan working, but I'm running into two issues. The first is that I'm recounting the same combination multiple times, I had a plan for this but it doesn't work because of the second issue, which is that with this current code, I can't figure out how to uninclude a branch that doesn't lead to a sum adding up to the target. |
| 2/2/25  | 9:00-10:00pm  | After some thinking about how else I would go about solving this, I decided to try changing the coins as well as the sum as we learned from the hint. I also was trying to calculate the largest coin first, then calculate how many of the smaller coins could go into the larger coin and that was I wouldn't have to recalculate the smaller ones for each one the larger was already calculated. Unfortunately, it's not working too well. |
| 2/6/25  |  2:45-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I started up the recursive solution to the problem, and created the first part of the memoization solution. I have to figure out how I'm going to standardize the indices of the 2d array. |
| 2/7/25  |  9:30-9:50am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I made progress on creating the memoization board, but now I have to figure out when I add to the board and what I add to it. |
| 2/9/25  | 11:30-11:45am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I made some minor changes and added to the memoization board in where I thought was the right place, but it didn't work. I didn't get the chance to debug it, that's what I'll do next. |
| 2/10/25 | 12:45-1:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I fixed the memoization, and that's now working. It turned out I had the concept, I just forgot to subtract by one when checking if the board index had an item in it. I'm just starting on tabulation now. |
| 2/12/25 | 10:15-10:40am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Wrote out the tabulation method on the board to better understand it. I think I'm getting close, but nothing's getting added and I don't want to debug right now. |
