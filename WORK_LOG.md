My plan is to finish that and then try some speedups to the algorithm and see where it goes from there |
| 2/2/25  | 7:50-8:30pm |  I got a running version of my plan working, but I'm running into two issues. The first is that I'm recounting the same combination multiple times, I had a plan for this but it doesn't work because of the second issue, which is that with this current code, I can't figure out how to uninclude a branch that doesn't lead to a sum adding up to the target. |
